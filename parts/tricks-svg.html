SVGs

SVGs can be used like images inside an &lt;img /&gt; tag or even an object tag.
They can also be inserted directly into the document, inline.

The main advantage of using the &lt;img /&gt; tag is that your source code seems lighter or easier to read.
Do we really care? Not really.

The disadvantage is that we can't target them.

Did you know?
You can actually apply CSS to SVGs?


If your SVG is inline, you can actually target the paths and fills with CSS.
Want to have a :hover or .active state for that logo? No problem, simply target the correct paths or fills.


Tip:
Want to keep your source clean and still use inline SVGs?
You could do it through PHP with something like
<?php include( 'svgs/my-svg-image.svg' ); ?>

Want to do it with JS?
You can simply keep an object handy along the lines of
var AllVectors = {
icon_bla : 'svg code to add',
icon_other_bla : '<svg code to add'
};

and then simply use JavaScript to inject them wherever you want.
