Bitmaps versus vectors

Bitmaps should only ever be used for "Pictures".
Think "photos".

If you got it as an .eps, .svg, .ai; <strong>DO NOT</strong> convert it to a bitmap image.

Bitmaps are a series of positions in a grid with a colour attached to each one.
Whenever they're not being displayed at their native resolution, the coputer has to "invent" pixel data between each of the real pixels. This is called interpollation. You never want that.
...especially not if we're dealing with decorative or brand assets like a logo.

A vector is based on math. It's a series of math equaltions that "describe" the image you see.
Since it's simply a seriez of variables, you can blow it up as big as a building or shrink it as small as a fly and it will always look good.
