Beyond the canvas

This is something you see a lot when you get web mockups from print designers.

You'll have a nice 1920px-wide PSD.
In it, you'll find a pleasantly interesting layer or layer group that should serve as the backdrop for the header.
Great.
Except that the header's imagery stretches from bound bound to bound.
Chances are that your visitors won't be viewing the site at the same size as the mockup.
This isn't "print". The canvas bounds are unknown.
What happens to the left of the header and to the right when the size of the window changes?
Do we break it off? (ewww!)
Do we add a little mask on both sides and fade to alpha 100% so that it "melts into a background colour"? How 2005!

This is information that needs to be transmitted. it isn't really up to us to guess.
